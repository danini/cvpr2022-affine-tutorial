## Welcome to the CVPR 2022 Affine Correspondences and Their Applications tutorial

The official site of the CVPR 2022 Affine Correspondences and Their Applications tutorial

# Abstract

The main objective of this tutorial is to present the theory and applications of affine correspondences (AC) in computer vision. The tutorial will show recent advancements in exploiting affine features in single- and two-view problems, including image rectification, homography and epipolar geometry estimation. Also, we will discuss traditional and recent deep learning-based algorithms for detecting, matching, and robustly using such features in real-world images.
